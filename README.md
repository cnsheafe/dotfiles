# My Personal Dotfiles

A set of config files primarily used for an Arch Linux setup. Also includes scripts for easier migration to a new system using the ["bottom-top" approach](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Migrate_installation_to_new_hardware#Bottom_to_top).

## Nomenclature

Files and folders starting with "dot" should be replaced with "." when adding to a system.

### Example for adding files

```bash
cp -r dotconfig ~/.config
```
